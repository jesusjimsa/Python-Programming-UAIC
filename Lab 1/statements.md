# Statements
1.  Find the largest common divisor of multiple numbers. Define a function with variable number of parameters to resolve this.    
2.	Write a function that calculates how many vowels are in a string.  
3.	Write a function that returns the number of words that exist in a string. Words are separated by spaces, punctuation marks (, ;, ? ! . )  
4.	Write a function that receives two strings as parameters and returns the number of occurrences of the first character string in the second.  
5.	Write a function that checks whether a character string contains special characters (\r, \t, \n, \a, \b, \f, \v)
6.	Write a function that converts a string of characters written in UpperCamelCase into lowercase_with_underscores.
7.	Write a function that receives a char_len integer and a variable number of strings (strings) and check that each two neighboring strings follow the following rule: the second string starts with the last char_len characters of the first string (like the word game pheasant).  
8.	Give a string that represents a polynomial (Ex: "3x ^ 3 + 5x ^ 2 - 2x - 5") and a number (whole or float). Evaluate the polynomial for the given value.  
9.	Write a function that returns the largest prime number from a string given as a parameter or -1 if the character string contains no prime number. Ex: input: 'ahsfaisd35biaishai23isisvdshcbsi271cidsbfsd97sidsda'; output: 271
