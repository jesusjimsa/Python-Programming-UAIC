# Write a search_by_content function that receives two target string and to_search as
# a parameter and returns a list of files containing to_search. The files are searched
# as follows: if the target is a file, it is searched only in that file and if it is
# a directory it will search recursively for all the files in that directory. If the
# target is neither a file nor a directory, it will drop a ValueError exception with 
# an appropriate message.
