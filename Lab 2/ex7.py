# Write a function that receives as default a default x number
# equal to 1, a variable number of strings, and a boolean flag
# set to True. For each character string, generate a list
# containing the characters that have the ASCII divisible by x
# if the flag is set to True, otherwise it should contain
# characters that have the non-xvid ASCII code. Example: x = 2,
# "test", "hello", "lab002", flag = False will return
# (["e", "s"], ["e" . Note: The function must return a variable
# number of lists that corresponds to the number of character
# strings received as an input.
