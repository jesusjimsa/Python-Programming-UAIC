# Lab 7

1. Write a program that will write the minutes run from the start, every x seconds, where x is random chosen at each iteration (from the interval [a, b] , where a, b are arguments). The program will run infinitely.
2. Write two functions to check if a number is prime, and check which of them is more time-efficient.
3. Find all the duplicate files in a directory given as an argument and display the run time. The path of the duplicate file groups will be written to an output.txt file. 
4. Write a script that receives a directory as argument and creates a JSON file with data about all the files in that directory. For each file, the following information will be displayed: file_name, md5_file, sha256_file, size_file (in bytes), time when the file was created (human-readable) and the absolute path to the file.
5. Write two scripts that communicate each other through serialized data. The first script will periodically save a list of all the files in a directory, and the second script will add in an archive all the files smaller than 100kb modified at most 5 minutes ago (the same file will not be added twice).
6. Write a script that writes the day of the week for the New Year Day, for the last x years (x is given as argument).
7. Simulate lotto 6/49 draw (numbers extraction).
